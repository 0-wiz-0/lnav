lnav v0.5.0:
     Features:
     * Files can be specified on the command-line using wildcards so that
       new files are automatically loaded.  Directories can also be passed
       as command-line arguments to read all of the files in the directory.
     * Builds on cygwin again.
     * Added the 'C' hotkey to clear any existing user bookmarks.
     * Added experimental support for accepting input from mice.

     Fixes:
     * Internal cleanup.
     * Copying to the clipboard on OS X is now supported.

lnav v0.4.0:
     Features:
     * Files that are not recognized as containing log messages have been
       broken out to a separate text files view.  You can flip between the
       log view and the text file view with the 't' hotkey.  When viewing
       text files, the 'f' hotkey will switch between files.
     * Files compressed with bzip2 are recognized and decompressed on the
       fly.
     * Added a "session" file and command for storing commands that should
       be executed on startup.  For example, if you always want some
       highlighting to be done, you can add that command to the session
       file.

     Fixes:
     * Add some more log file formats for generic log files.
     * Performance improvements for compressed files.
     * Works on OS X now.

lnav v0.3.0:
     Changes:
     * The hotkey for the SQL view was changed to 'v' and 'V' from '.'.

     Features:
     * You can now switch between the SQL result view and the log view while
       keeping the top of the views in sync with the "line_number" column.

     Fixes:
     * The "line_number" column is no longer included in the SQL result view's
       stacked bar graph.
     * Added a "warnings" count to the histogram view.
