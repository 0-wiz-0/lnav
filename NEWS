lnav v0.3.0:  (St. Patrick's Day Release)
     Changes:
     * The hotkey for the SQL view was changed to 'v' and 'V' from '.'.

     Features:
     * You can now switch between the SQL result view and the log view while
       keeping the top of the views in sync with the "line_number" column.

     Fixes:
     * The "line_number" column is no longer included in the SQL result view's
       stacked bar graph.
     * Added a "warnings" count to the histogram view.
