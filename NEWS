lnav v0.6.3:
     Features:
     * Add the '.schema' SQL command to open a view that displays the schema
       for the internal tables and any attached databases.  If lnav was only
       executed with a SQLite database and no text files, this view will open
       by default.
     * The scroll bar now indicates the location of errors/warnings, search
       hits, and bookmarks.
     * The xterm title is update to reflect the file name for the top line
       in the view.
     * Added a "headless" mode so that you can execute commands and run SQL
       queries from the command-line without having to do it from the curses
       UI.
     * When doing a search or SQL query, any text that is currently being
       displayed can be tab-completed.
     * The '-H' option was added so you can view the internal help text.
     * Added the 'g/G' hotkeys to move to the top/bottom of the file.

     Fixes:
     * Performance improvements.
     * Multi-line filtering has been fixed.
     * A collator has been added to the log_level column in the log tables
       so that you can write expressions like "log_level > 'warning'".
     * The log_time datetime format now matches what is returned by
       "datetime('now')" so that collating works correctly.
     * Static-linking has been cleaned up.
     * OpenSSL is no longer a requirement.
     * Alpha support for Windows/cygwin.

lnav v0.6.2:
     Features:
     * Word-wrap support.

     Fixes:
     * Fix some OS X Mavericks build/runtime issues.

lnav v0.6.1:
     Features:
     * Support for JSON-encoded log files.

     Fixes:
     * Some minor fixes and performance improvements.

lnav v0.6.0:
     Features:
     * Custom log formats and more builtin formats
     * Automatic extraction of data from logs
     * UI improvements, support for 256 color terminals

lnav v0.5.1:
     Features:
     * Added the '-t' and '-w' options which can be used to prepend a
       timestamp to any data piped in on stdin and to specify a file to
       write the contents of stdin to.

     Fixes:
     * Cleanup for packaging.

lnav v0.5.0:
     Features:
     * Files can be specified on the command-line using wildcards so that
       new files are automatically loaded.  Directories can also be passed
       as command-line arguments to read all of the files in the directory.
     * Builds on cygwin again.
     * Added the 'C' hotkey to clear any existing user bookmarks.
     * Added experimental support for accepting input from mice.

     Fixes:
     * Internal cleanup.
     * Copying to the clipboard on OS X is now supported.
     * Many bug fixes.

lnav v0.4.0:
     Features:
     * Files that are not recognized as containing log messages have been
       broken out to a separate text files view.  You can flip between the
       log view and the text file view with the 't' hotkey.  When viewing
       text files, the 'f' hotkey will switch between files.
     * Files compressed with bzip2 are recognized and decompressed on the
       fly.
     * Added a "session" file and command for storing commands that should
       be executed on startup.  For example, if you always want some
       highlighting to be done, you can add that command to the session
       file.

     Fixes:
     * Add some more log file formats for generic log files.
     * Performance improvements for compressed files.
     * Works on OS X now.

lnav v0.3.0:
     Changes:
     * The hotkey for the SQL view was changed to 'v' and 'V' from '.'.

     Features:
     * You can now switch between the SQL result view and the log view while
       keeping the top of the views in sync with the "line_number" column.

     Fixes:
     * The "line_number" column is no longer included in the SQL result view's
       stacked bar graph.
     * Added a "warnings" count to the histogram view.
